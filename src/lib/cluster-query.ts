/**
 * The trade search that prices one cluster jewel combo (poestash #212).
 *
 * What this prices is **the jewel the craft produces**: the target notables on
 * a base of the passive count the craft is worth doing at. The passive count is
 * a filter and not an afterthought — a Medium with the same two notables and 6
 * passives, or a Large with 12, is a different item that lists for a fraction
 * of the price, and taking the cheapest listing without the filter hands the
 * app that fraction as the revenue side of a profit it computed against a
 * 4-5 (or 8) passive base. The result is a systematic understatement of profit.
 *
 * The query *shape* deliberately matches `clusterCraftTradeUrl` in the app
 * (`lib/trade/build-trade-url.ts`), which is the link the player clicks from the
 * row this price feeds. Cross-repo, so nothing can assert the two agree — the
 * test below pins this shape so a change to it is a deliberate one, and the app
 * side has to be checked by hand.
