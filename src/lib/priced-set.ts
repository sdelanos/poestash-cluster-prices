 * indexed a league yet won't have it fabricated, and the caller can't try to
 * fetch a league its own upstream doesn't serve.
 *
 * More than one challenge league can be live at once: a rollover briefly lists
 * the old and new leagues together, and a standalone event can run alongside
 * the main league. We price all of them rather than guess which is "the"
 * league, so the main economy is never dropped. Sources may or may not expose
 * dates; when an endAt is present and in the past that league is treated as
 * ended and skipped.
 *
 * This is the one piece of league logic shared across the heterogeneous
 * workers (poe.watch, poe.ninja index-state, ...), so it takes a minimal shape
 * and works on names alone.
